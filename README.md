A simple Python-based [ProXPN](https://www.proxpn.com/index.php) client. This module automate updating and running ProXPN on Linux. Currently they support versions for Windows and Mac, but running on Linux has always been very manual. This is currently a bare-bones, running version, where a lot of the interaction is manual.
